  summary: `I am a fourth-year computer engineering student at Izmir Bakırçay University with a strong drive for success.
I am actively improving myself in backend development and machine learning.
I have experience in data analysis, data cleaning, and training models using various algorithms.
I can also deploy trained models using FastAPI and Docker.
In backend development, I primarily use .NET Core with C# and focus on mastering architectures like microservices, layered architecture, and CQRS.
I believe that understanding these concepts deeply will make it easier to adapt to other technologies and languages.
I enjoy learning new technologies, solving challenging problems, and continuously enhancing my skill set.
Currently, I’m seeking a backend development internship opportunity, especially in .NET stack, to apply my knowledge and gain real-world experience.`,
